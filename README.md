# Frequently Asked Questions

## How to find the "best" gpu to buy?

Best is subjective, but there are plenty of options to sort the gpus by.
Launch the app and click Max My ROI.
Then sort the list by clicking on one of the column headers.
If you're looking for low power usage and high profits click Efficiency.
If you're looking for low cost and high profits regardless of power click $/Mhs.
If you're looking for the quickest ROI click ROI.
If you just want the cheapest gpu click Price.

## Which price is used for the calculations? MSRP, Ebay, or Price Paid?

If there is an amount given for the Price Paid it will always be used. However, if no Price Paid is given then the Ebay price will be used. The only time MSRP is used is if there were no reputable Ebay listings to get a price.


## How to find the most profitable coin to mine for my gpu?

Launch the app and click Max My ROI. Then find your gpu in the list.

Alternatively, you can create a new gpu list by clicking the Add button near gpu lists. 
Then make sure to give the list a name.
Here you can add your gpu or multiple gpus along with their hashrates.
Then click Max My ROI.

## How to find the hashrate for my gpu?

Select the Default gpu list and click the edit button near Gpu Lists. Then find your gpu in the list and click on it.
You can copy hashrates for a single coin from here and paste it into your own custom gpu list. Make sure you have the whole row selected then press Ctr+C.
Next you can click cancel then select the gpu list for the gpu you want to paste the hashrates to and make sure the hashrates table has focus then press Ctr+V. If you want to add a coin that isn't listed just select the empty row and add the hashrate info manually.

## How to find the cheapest gpu on ebay?

There are two ways. You can click on one of the gpus that appear after clicking Max My ROI. Then click the Ebay Link above that list.

Or

Select the Default gpu list and click the edit button. Next find the gpu you are looking for and click it, then click the Ebay Link. If that isn't the right gpu/item then you can use the dropdown menu to select the next cheapest option.

## Why do I sometimes get the wrong gpu, or no gpu at all, when I click on an Ebay Link?

Unfortunetly, it is out of my skill set to search each ebay images for every gpu listing in order to get all of the necessary information, because sometimes a seller will only post the important details in an image.
I have done my best to create an algorithm that can find the cheapest gpu from a reputable seller on ebay.
A seller must have at least 100 feedback and a score of at least 97% for me to even consider the listing.
I also only look at Buy It Now listings so its possible you could find an even cheaper gpu if you play the auction game.


## Disclaimer

Although I do my best to provide trustworthy ebay listings that I would purchase my self. There is always the possiblity that a reputable seller's Ebay account gets hacked or a reputable seller could be going through some rough times and decides to scam someone. Do your own due diligence when it comes to using Ebay and if it seems too good to be true it probably is. Don't risk saving a few dollars by purchasing from an untrustworthy source but if you do then use PayPal - Goods and Services only or a credit card so if you do get scammed you can just do a charge back to get your money back.
