## How to find the "best" gpu to buy?
Best is subjective, but there are plenty of options to sort the gpus by.
Launch the app and click Max My ROI.
Then sort the list by clicking on one of the column headers.
If you're looking for low power usage high profits click Efficiency.
If you're looking for low cost high profits regardless of power click $/Mhs.
If you're looking for the quickest ROI click ROI.
If you just want the cheapest gpu click Price.

## How to find the most profitable coin to mine for my gpu?
Launch the app and click Max My ROI. Then find your gpu in the list.

Alternatively, you can create a new gpu list by clicking the Add button near gpu lists. 
Then make sure to give the list a name.
Here you can add your gpu or multiple gpus along with their hashrates.
Then click Max My ROI.

## How to find the hashrate for my gpu?
Click the edit button  near Gpu Lists and find your gpu in the list and click on it.
You can copy default hashrates for a single coin from here and paste it into your own custom gpu list.

## How to find the cheapest gpu on ebay?
There are two ways. You can click on one of the gpus that appear after clicking Max My ROI.
Then click the Ebay Link above that list.
Or
Click the edit button nearest the gpu lists.
Then find the gpu you are looking for and click it.
Click the Ebay Link. If that isn't the right gpu/item then you can use the dropdown menu to select the next cheapest option.

## Why do I sometimes get the wrong gpu when I click on an Ebay Link?
Unfortunetly, it is out of my skill set to search each ebay image for every gpu listing in order to get all of the necessary information, because sometimes a seller will only post the important details in an image.
I have done my best to create an algorithm that can find the cheapest gpu from a reputable seller on ebay.
A seller must have at least 100 feedback and a score of at least 97% for me to even consider the listing.
I also only look at Buy It Now listings so its possible you could find an even cheaper gpu if you play the auction game.


## Why do I see { Text = gpu name $price, Value = Max_Gpu_Roi.EbayItem } in the ebay dropdown menus?
It is a limitation of the combo box that I used. There is surely a better way of doing it, and it will be updated when I can get around to it.
